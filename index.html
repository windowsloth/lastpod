        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a chart of connections between people/groups that have been
	  covered on the Last Podcast on the Left. It's definitely an incomplete
	  list, but I am working on adding to it over time. There are a lot of
	  episodes to comb through, so this is represents just what I have
	  listened to recently, and what I could remember off the top of my head.</p>
        <h2>Help</h2>
        <p>Click and drag to move around the diagram. Use the zoom slider to
          zoom in/out. Click on "pins" to highlight connections, and to display
          additional information below the diagram.</p>
        <h2>Other Notes</h2>
        <p>You might notice that there are almost no Heavy Hitters included in
          in the chart. There's a handful of reasons for that.</p>
        <p>First of all, the Heavy Hitters are for the most part lone wolves.
          There isn't much that actually ties them to anyone else on the chart
          in a meaningful way, so there's no point in including them.</p>
        <p>The second reason is that when there is some kind of potential
          connection, it's usually something made up. This might seem like a
	  weird sticking point, since a vast majority of the information
          this chart is based on could be called made up, but for me there's a
          difference Obvious Bullshit and Fun Bullshit.</p>
        <p>For example, at the end of Ep. 100: Bundy Pt. 2, there is a very
          brief discussion about a theory that Bundy took the fall for a series
          of crimes committed by a young George Bush, but it is presented as a
          joke and not taken at all seriously.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, most of Ep. 188: the Dulce Facility Pt. 2 deals
	  with the fact that Dulce as described by Thomas Castello probably does
	  not exist. The difference is that there is the
          better part of two episodes spent on the topic, and it also fits into
          the larger narrative of aliens and the Secret Government.</p>
        <p>There's definitely a lot of gray area in there, but it's been working
	   for me up to this point.</p><br>
	      <p>Thank you for checking this out, and I hope you found it interesting.</p>
	      <p>Hail yourself, and hail Satan!</p>

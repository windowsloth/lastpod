        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>This is a chart of connections between individuals and groups that
          have been convered on the Last Podcast on the Left.</p>
        <p>I was inspired to work on this by a moment in Episode 413: Lobotomies
           Pt. 1, when Ben, Henry, and Marcus joke about what it would look like
            to map out all the connections between the characters they've
            covered.
          This joke was in reference to Walter Freeman having been friends with
          Aleš Hrdlička (of Episode 406: Giant Humanoids fame) while living in
           Washington D.C., but soon afterwards this was followed by an offhand
           mention
          that Freeman dated a woman who would go on to date Allen Dulles.
          I realized that this tied Freeman to Dulles, and that both of them
          were connected to JFK (Freeman having personally lobotomized Rosmeary
          Kennedy, and Dulles as part of the Warren Commision).</p>
        <p>The chart is currently far from complete! I've done my best to cover
          a large number of episodes, but there's a lot to comb through.</p>
        <h2>Important Notes</h2>
        <p>You might notice that there are almost no Heavy Hitters included in
          in the chart. I did this for two reasons.</p>
        <p>First of all, the Heavy Hitters are for the most part lone wolves.
          There isn't much that actually ties them to anyone else on the chart
          in a meaningful way, so there's no point in including them.</p>
        <p>The second reason is that when there is some kind of potential
          connection, it's usually something made up. This might seem like a
          strange point to bring up, since a vast majority of the information
          this chart is based on could be called made up, but I think there's a
          difference Obvious Bullshit and Fun Bullshit.</p>
        <p>For example, at the end of Episode 100: Bundy Pt. 2, there is a very
          brief discussion about a theory that Bundy took the fall for a series
          of crimes committed by a young George Bush, but it is presented as a
          joke and not taken seriously.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, much of the latter half of Episode 188: the Dulce
          Facility Pt. 2 deals with the fact that Dulce as described by Thomas
          Castello likely does not exist. The difference is that there is the
          better part of two episodes spent on the topic, and it also fits into
          the larger narrative of aliens and the Secret Government.</p>
        <p>There is, of course, a gray area when it comes to topics like Henry
          Lee Lucas and the Hand of Death, which is definitely framed as drifter
          improv, but still discussed at length for an entire episode. There are
          probably other similar topics, and I may revist my stance on this, but
          for the moment, this system works for me.</p>
